# <Challenge-01>

## Description

This is a small project that is a simple landing page. The purpose of this project is to practice refractoring code for a basic page with HTML and CSS elements. 

The Base code provided worked to display the webpage and the final result is visually the same, however both the HTML and CSS have been revised for readability. Comments have been added to seperate sections and the CSS has been condensed to eliminate redundancy. In the HTML, now unused class tags have been removed.
